        His cousin Vikas, a colonel, sobs uncontrollably. Dhonchak’s wife Jyoti, who had visited Kashmir recently, was eerily quiet, even when her husband’s colleagues from Jalandhar paid a visit. He leaves behind his daughter, two and a half years old, and was the only son of his father, a retired National Fertilizers Limited clerk. He has three sisters.<br/>
        All his kin, friends and villagers say how Ashish was a brilliant student and had a great sense of humour. “He would light up everything around him,” said Ravi Mann, Ashish’s school friend who was in regular touch with him. Showing a WhatsApp group comprising himself, Ashish and another friend, Ravi said he had known Ashish since they were in Class 1.<br/>
        “We were always together. My old house was just five minutes away and we would hang out after school. Ashish was brilliant and hard working as a student and went on to become the school head in Class 12. When he chose B Tech, we parted ways but stayed close as he would come home every month. Even after he cleared the exam for the armed forces, we never drifted apart. I last spoke to him yesterday on WhatsApp. We called frequently on FaceTime and knew what was happening in each other’s lives,” Ravi said.<br/>
        Ashish cleared GATE and joined an engineering college in Patiala before clearing the armed forces entrance exam in 2012 during his first year in college. “Ashish was aware of the risk that came with his job. He won this year’s Sena Medal on Independence Day,” said Ravi.<br/>
